### If I remember correctly, these are the things that I have learned in the year 2018:

<br>

1. Host websites on github. Add custom domain name. And host apps on heroku and mblab.
2. Implement routing.
3. A lot of css and some animations.
4. CSS ui libraries like Bulma and Bootstrap.
5. The basics of the following technologies:
    * Vuejs
    * Node and Express
    * Mongodb
    * Postgresql
    * Graphql
    * Fecth
    * Google Maps
    * Meta tags
    * Postgress
6. Perhaps the greatest of them all is learning React. It taught me a lot of the basic principles of programming and javascript. Their huge community and a great number of libraries and toolings makes website development faster and more enjoyable.

##### Reflection
*I learned a lot, but I know I could have done better.*

<br>

### Here are the things I plan to do this year and promise to stick to it no matter how hard it can be:

<br/>

##### Plan of Action
*This year will be different. I will be more focused and result-oriented. Every technology that I will learn must be accompanied with a project built by me based on reading documentations and google searching and not just by following some courses out there.*

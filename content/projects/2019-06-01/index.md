### Things I learned this week:

1. Learn the few basics of **NodeJS**.
2. Refreshed on handling **routes** in **express**.
3. Basic idea on **MVC** (Model, View, and Controller).
4. Introduced to 3 most-used templating engines namely **EJS**, **Pug**, and **Handlebars**. Though I probably would not use them for any of my future projects, learning them was fun.
5. Basic concept in **Relational Database Design**.
6. Basic use of **React.Children** and **React.cloneElement API**

##### Reflection

_Learning is fun. Gotta keep going._

### Plans

1. By next week, I should finish half or more of the course on my current nodejs course.
2. Start a course on wordpress. So at least I know the basics.
3. Add netlifycms to this website.

_This list will be altered and updated monthly. Wish me luck!_

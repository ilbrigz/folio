### If I remember correctly, these are the things that I have learned in the year 2018:

<br>

1. Host websites on github. Add custom domain name. And host apps on heroku and mblab.
2. Implement routing.
3. A lot of css and some animations.
4. CSS ui libraries like Bulma and Bootstrap.
5. The basics of the following technologies:
   - Vuejs
   - Node and Express
   - Mongodb
   - Postgresql
   - Graphql
   - Fetch
   - Google Maps
   - Meta tags
   - Postgress
6. Perhaps the greatest of them all is learning React. It taught me a lot of the basic principles of programming and javascript. Their huge community and a great number of libraries and toolings makes website development faster and more enjoyable.
